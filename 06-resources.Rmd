## Help and fruther Resources

### Seurat Vignettes {-}

https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html
 
There are a good many Seurat vigettes for different aspects of the Seurat package. E.g. 

* [Guided Clustering tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html) : We've just worked through this
* [Differential expression](https://satijalab.org/seurat/archive/v3.1/de_vignette.html) : An Exploration of differential expression methods within Seurat
* [Data integration](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_introduction.html) : Seurat's data integration is a popular method to combine different datasets into one joint analysis.
* [Merging seurat objectsl](https://satijalab.org/seurat/archive/v4.3/merge)): For handling real life experiments with more than one sample!


### Seurat Cheatsheet {-}

https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/essential_commands.html

A useful resource for asking; How can I do 'X' with my seurat object?


### OSCA {-}

https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/

An comprehensive resource for analysis approaches for single cell data. 
This uses the SingleCellExperiment bioconductor ecosystem, but alot of the same principle still apply. 

This includes a good discussion of useing [pseudobulk approaches](http://bioconductor.org/books/3.15/OSCA.multisample/multi-sample-comparisons.html#creating-pseudo-bulk-samples), worth checking out for  differential expression analyses.


### MBP training Reading list {-}

https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/Single-Cell-Workshop/

A workshop page for a previous workshop (upon which this one is based) run by Monash Bioinformatics Platform  - down the bottom there
is an extensive list of useful single cell links and resources.


### Biocommons Single Cell Omics {-}

https://www.biocommons.org.au/single-cell-omics

Join the single cell omics community resources being setup by biocommons.

## Data

### Demo 10X data {-}

https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets

10X genomics have quite a few example datasets availble for download (including PBMC3k). 
This is a useful resource if you want to see what the 'raw' data looks like for a particular technology.



### GEO {-}

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/

Many papers publish their raw single cell data in GEO. Formats vary, but often you can find the counts matrix.



### Seurat data {-}

https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-data

Package for obtaining a few datasets as seurat objects.



<!-- ### scRNAseq {-} -->
<!-- https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/scRNAseq.html -->
<!-- Preloaded sce data. -->

## Analysis Tools 

A handful of the many tools that might be worth checking out for next steps.

### Cyclone {-}

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26142758/

Part of the scran package, cyclone is a(nother) method for determining cell phase.
[Doco](https://rdrr.io/bioc/scran/man/cyclone.html)


### Harmony {-}

https://portals.broadinstitute.org/harmony/articles/quickstart.html

Method for integration of multiple single cell datasets.


### SingleR {-}

http://bioconductor.org/books/release/SingleRBook/

There is extensive documentation for the singleR package in the 'singleR' book.

### Scrublet {-}

https://github.com/swolock/scrublet

A python based tool for doublet detection. One of many tools in this space.

### ScVelo {-}

https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/

A package for single cell RNA velocity analysis, useful for developmental/pseudotime trajectories. Python/scanpy based.


### Monocle {-}

https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/

A package for single cell developmental//pseudotime trajectory analysis.



### TidySeurat {-}

https://stemangiola.github.io/tidyseurat/

For fans of tidyverse-everything, there's tidyseurat. Example workflow [here](https://tidytranscriptomics-workshops.github.io/bioc2022_tidytranscriptomics/articles/tidytranscriptomics_case_study.html)


----------------

## Preprocessing Tools

Tooks that process raw sequencing data into counts matricies

### Cell Ranger {-}

https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger

CellRanger is the 10X tool that takes raw fastq sequence files and produces the counts matricies that are the starting point for today's analysis. It only works for 10X data.


### STARSolo {-}

STAR is an aligner (which is actually used within cell ranger). STARSolo is a tool for producing counts matricies, and is configurable enough for use with multiple technologies.
