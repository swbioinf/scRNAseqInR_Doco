# Cluster Markers {#clustermarkers}

#### Why do we need to do this?  {- .rational}

Single cell data helps to segragate cell types. Use markers to identify cell types. warning: In this example the cell types/markers are well known and making this step easy, but in reality this step needs the experts curation.

## Use markers to label or find a cluster


If you know markers for your cell types, use AddModuleScore to label them.

```{r}
genes_markers <- list(Naive_CD4_T = c("IL7R", "CCR7"))

pbmc <- AddModuleScore(object = pbmc, features = genes_markers, ctrl = 5, name = "Naive_CD4_T",
    search = TRUE)


# notice the name of the cluster has a 1 at the end
names(pbmc@meta.data)

# label that cell type
pbmc$cell_label = NA
pbmc$cell_label[pbmc$Naive_CD4_T1 > 1] = "Naive_CD4_T"
Idents(pbmc) = pbmc$cell_label

# plot
# Using a custom colour scale 
FeaturePlot(pbmc, features = "Naive_CD4_T1", label = TRUE, repel = TRUE, ) + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = c("lightblue","beige","red"))
```
