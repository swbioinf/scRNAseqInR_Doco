This workshop follows the introductory [Guided Clustering Tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html) tutorial from Seurat.


It is also drawing from a similar workshop held by Monash Bioinformatics Platform [Single-Cell-Workshop](https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/Single-Cell-Workshop/), with material [here](https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/Single-Cell-Workshop/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)
